# RAMPVIS
RAMPVIS is an architecture for visualizing data related to COVID-19. The system consists of three parts, the [API](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/rampvis-api), the [UI](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/rampvis-ui), and the [Ontology Management System](https://github.com/saifulkhan/rampvis-ontology-management-ui). In addition to the locations given by the hyperlinks these components can also be found in the respective directories in this repository ([``rampvis-api``](rampvis-api), [``rampvis-ui``](rampvis-ui), [``rampvis-ontology-management-ui``](rampvis-ontology-management-ui)). This repository is intended to consolidate all code associated with RAMPVIS, as of 24th of March 2023, in a single place. 

### Functionalities
RAMPVIS contains a number of visualizations and  for COVID-19 data, a live version of the system is hosted at [vis.scrc.uk](https://vis.scrc.uk). A key feature of the system is the ability to “propagate”
a visualization designed for one data source to similar ones, to quickly visualise large amounts of data. See videos in the supplementary materials of the SoftwareX paper for an overview of the features of the system and a step by step guide for how to propagate visualizations.

### Get started
To start the RAMPVIS system, follow the guide in the [``rampvis-api``](rampvis-api) directory. This explains the whole process.
There are also videos explaining the process in the supplementary material of the SoftwareX paper.
