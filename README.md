# RAMPVIS
RAMPVIS is an architecture for visualizing data related to COVID-19. The system consists of three parts, the [API](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/rampvis-api), the [UI](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/rampvis-ui), and the [Ontology Management System](https://github.com/saifulkhan/rampvis-ontology-management-ui). In addition to the locations given by the hyperlinks these components can also be found in the respective directories in this repository ([``rampvis-api``](rampvis-api), [``rampvis-ui``](rampvis-ui), [``rampvis-ontology-management-ui``](rampvis-ontology-management-ui)). This repository is intended to consolidate all code associated with RAMPVIS, as of 24th of March 2023, in a single place. 

### Functionalities
RAMPVIS contains a number of visualizations and  for COVID-19 data. A key feature of the system is the ability to “propagate”
a visualization designed for one data source to similar ones, to quickly visualize large amounts of data. See videos in the supplementary materials of the SoftwareX paper for an overview of the features of the system and a step-by-step guide for how to propagate visualizations.

### Get started
To start the RAMPVIS system, follow the guide in the [``rampvis-api``](rampvis-api) directory. This explains the whole process.
There are also videos explaining the process in the supplementary material of the SoftwareX paper.

### Repositories for Active development
As SoftwareX requires all the code to be in a single repository the code for the three systems making up RAMPVIS, which were previously housed in separate repositories, were collected into this repository. It may be beneficial to know where the "active" repositories, containing the most recent changes to the individual systems in the future, may be found. This is shown in the table below.

| System      | Active repository                    |
